# Homework #0

- Due: Monday 23, October, 2017

## Description

This homework consists in train and evaluate, three different computer vision datasets, using KNN and SVM. The datasets are

- (MNIST)[http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/]
- (CIFAR10)[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html]
- (SVHN)[http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/]

## Instructions

- Train and evaluate each dataset using KNN, and SVM
- Find the best parameters for each algorithm
- Try different image representations (pixels, histogram)

## Tips

1. Make multiple tests (use scripts)


## Evaluation

Grade = 0.5 Code * 0.5 Presentation

#### Code

1. 4 if each dataset has been train with KNN and SVM
2. 5, if 1, and cross-validation was used to find the best parameters 
3. 6, if 2, and different image representation method have been used
4. 7, if 3 works, it has a clear code, multiple experiments, and good comments

#### Presentation 

Must contain

1. Training and testing methodology
2. Analysis of datasets
3. Analysis of results
4. Analysis of prediction algorithms
5. Conclusions

## Submission

1. Submissions are through Platea.
2. Submission must include the training and evaluation code compressed as a zip file
3. Submission must include slides (presentation) 
4. The zip file must be named homework_1_rut.zip . Rut in the format XXXXXXXX-X
